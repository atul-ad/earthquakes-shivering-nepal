# Earthquakes: Shivering Nepal

**Author:** Atul Adhikari (atul-ad)

## Description
Experiencing the tremors of the 2072 Gorkha Earthquake, the fear of the 2080 Jajarkot Earthquake, and subsequent earthquake swarms forced me to understand deep into the seismic activities of Nepal. This research report covers various aspects of earthquakes in Nepal, emphasizing the importance of awareness and preparedness.

## Key Highlights
- Analysis of past significant earthquakes in Nepal.
- Predictions by seismologists about potential future mega-quakes.
- The apparent lack of concern and preparedness among authorities and the general public.
- Recommendations for emergency preparedness, including kits, education, and infrastructure retrofitting.

## Call to Action
Nepal lies in a high-risk seismic zone. It's imperative for individuals, communities, and the government to take proactive measures to mitigate potential disasters. I urge every reader to participate in awareness campaigns and preparedness initiatives to safeguard lives and heritage.
